# Weather App made with React

With this app you can browse through small informative country cards using the RESTFul API from [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/), and by clicking them each one will take you to a new page with its capital's city weather status and forecast. The data for that is facilitated by the One Call API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

This is a project done for the program in Web Development [@Helsinki Business School](https://en.bc.fi) (Oct 2023). The main focus was gettting acquinted with [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and the implemention of robust authentication tools, like the ones [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) provided for this case.
